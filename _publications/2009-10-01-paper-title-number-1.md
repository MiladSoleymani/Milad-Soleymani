excerpt: 'Abstract. Common Spatial Patterns (CSP) has been established as a power feature extraction method in EEG signal processing with machine learning. However, it has shortcomings like sensitivity to noise and rigidity in the value of the weights. In this paper, we introduce a novel neural network architecture layer (POC-CSP) that transforms CSP into a trainable machine learning model that can learn from training data, regularised, and be used in an end-to-end classification network. Evaluating POC-CSP, we show it outperforms conventional CSP in BCI motor imagery task and has the ability to generalise well to unseen data if uses as a pre-trained neural network. POC-CSP can be prepended to any neural network classifier and trained end-to-end to improve EEG signal decoding.'
