excerpt: 'The paper "A Deep Learning Algorithm for Classifying Grasp Motions using Multi-session EEG Recordings" introduces a novel classification method for motor imagery tasks involving grasp motions, utilizing a combination of anomaly detection and neural network models, including both fully connected and convolutional neural networks. It successfully classifies three types of grasp motions (cylindrical, spherical, and lumbrical) using EEG data from multi-session recordings. The study achieves more than 80% accuracy in some subjects and an average of 57% across a cohort, demonstrating the efficacy of deep learning in decoding complex motor intentions from EEG signals, despite variations in signal quality across different sessions. This approach marks a significant advancement in the practical application of BCIs for interpreting nuanced human intentions.'

Abstract: The classification of motor imagery tasks using scalp EEG signals is a complicated procedure in BCI especially when the task comprises multiple gestures of the same hand. In this paper, we present a classification method to distinguish three grasp motion classes (cylindrical, spherical, and lumbrical) of one hand over two-day training sessions in 15 subjects in a public dataset. We have developed Two ensemble methods consisting of (anomaly detection + fully connected neural network) and (anomaly detection + convolutional neural network) to classify grasp motion and have achieved more than 80% classification accuracy in 3 subjects and an average accuracy of 57% among the full cohort. Our results confirm the possibility of utilizing neural networks to decode motor movement intentions from scalp EEG in a complicated task.
