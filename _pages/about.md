I'm **Milad Soleymani**, an AI/ML specialist with a strong foundation in electrical engineering and a deep passion for applying machine learning in diverse fields like medicine and autonomous systems. I‚Äôm excited to share my journey and projects with you!

## About Me

üìö **Academic Background:** I graduated with a B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering from K. N. Toosi University of Technology, where I developed a keen interest in the potential of AI. My thesis project on semantic segmentation of videos further honed my skills in computer vision.

üë®üèª‚Äçüíª **What I Do:** I specialize in designing and improving neural networks and training algorithms. I have experience in EEG signal analysis, voice recognition, creating doctor assistant chatbots with LLM models, and developing image generation models. This shows my wide-ranging knowledge and skills in this area.
