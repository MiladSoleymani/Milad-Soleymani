## Overview
This document outlines the design of an innovative solution for detecting the shape, angle, and location of objects on conveyor belts. The goal is to aid robotic systems in picking operations with enhanced precision and efficiency. This solution integrates advanced sensing technologies, machine learning algorithms, and robotic systems to create a seamless automated process.

## Objectives
1. **Accurate Object Detection**: Precisely identify the shape, angle, and location of objects on conveyor belts.
2. **Enhanced Robotic Picking**: Improve the precision and efficiency of robotic systems in picking operations.
3. **Real-Time Processing**: Ensure real-time detection and processing to keep up with conveyor belt speeds.

## Components

### 1. Data Acquisition
The first step involves collecting data from the conveyor belt system. This is achieved using a combination of sensors and cameras:
- **High-Resolution Cameras**: Capture images of objects on the conveyor belt.
- **LiDAR Sensors**: Provide additional spatial information for enhanced accuracy.

### 2. Data Processing
Collected data needs to be processed to extract relevant information about the objects:
- **Image Processing**: Use image processing techniques to identify the shape and outline of objects.
- **Depth Analysis**: Analyze depth data from LiDAR to determine the angle and orientation of objects.

### 3. Algorithm Design
The core algorithm for detecting shape, angle, and location involves several key components:
- **Object Detection Models**: Using Oriented Bounding Boxes Object Detection (YOLO OBB) models to detect, classify, and estimate the angle of objects.

### 4. Robotic System Integration
Integrate the detection system with robotic systems for picking operations:
- **Robotic Arm Calibration**: Ensure that robotic arms are calibrated to pick objects based on the detected shape, angle, and location.
- **Real-Time Coordination**: Develop software to synchronize the detection system with robotic actions in real-time.
- **Error Handling**: Implement error handling mechanisms to manage misdetections or mispicks.

### 5. Optimization and Improvement
Continuously improve the system by:
- **Feedback Mechanisms**: Implement feedback loops from the robotic systems to enhance detection algorithms.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track key metrics such as detection accuracy, processing time, and picking efficiency.

## Technologies Needed
